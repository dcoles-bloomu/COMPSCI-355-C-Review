# COMPSCI-355-CppReview

Source files contained in the sub-folders are presented in class in the order shown. Each is designed to provide a context for the review of one or more topics relating to C++. The documentation at the top of each file identifies the topic(s) to be discussed, as does the list below.

Part 1. Documentation, function prototypes, command-line arguments, seeding the random number generator, static casting, stream manipulators, dynamic allocation of arrays, memory leaks. 

Part 2. Passing arguments by value, pointer value, and reference. 

Part 3. Partial initialization of an array, array arguments passed by reference, and deallocation of 2D arrays. 

Part 4. Destructors, assert macro, const methods, and prefix vs. postfix increment.

Part 5. Separate compilation and namespaces.

Part 6. Copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators.

Part 7. Function templates, template functions, and strings.

Part 8. Class templates, template classes, and the impossibility of separate compilation with template classes.

Part 9. The ArrayList class as a raw type, why generics in Java can only be parameterized by reference types, and the difference between template classes in C++ and generics in Java.

Part 10. STL containers and iterators.

Part 11. Operator overloading, friend functions, and default arguments.
